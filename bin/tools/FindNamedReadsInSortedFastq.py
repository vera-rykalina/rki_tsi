  ## Overview: takes a fastq file sorted by read name, e.g. with
  ## $ cat MyReads.fq | paste - - - - | sort -k1,1 -t " " | tr "\t" "\n" > out.fq
  ## and a file of read names sorted in the same way (one read name per line), and
  ## finds those reads, printing them to the screen suitable for redirection into
  ## another fastq file. Alternatively the reads need not be sorted: see options.
  ## Usage:
  ## $ FindNamedReadsInSortedFastq.py AllReadsSorted.fastq ReadNamesIwant.txt
